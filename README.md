#  Candidate task Feedback Collector 

This is the frontend codebase for our application, built using modern web development tools and practices.

## Key Technologies

This project leverages the following important packages for development:

* **React (`react`, `react-dom`):** The core JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We use React's component-based architecture to create reusable and maintainable UI elements.

* **React Router DOM (`react-router-dom`):** Provides declarative, component-based routing for React applications. This allows us to manage navigation within the application without full page reloads, creating a smoother user experience.

* **React Hook Form (`react-hook-form`):** A powerful and performant library for handling forms in React. It simplifies form state management, validation, and submission using React Hooks.

* **Axios (`axios`):** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to our backend. It provides a clean and easy way to interact with external services.

* **TanStack React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`):** A data fetching and state management library for React. It simplifies fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating data in your application, making data-intensive tasks easier to manage.

* **React Hot Toast (`react-hot-toast`):** A lightweight and customizable library for displaying elegant toast notifications to the user, providing feedback on actions or events.

* **Vite (`vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`):** A fast and modern build tool that provides an excellent development experience with features like hot module replacement (HMR) and lightning-fast builds.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you can usually access the application at `http://localhost`.

## Available Scripts

* `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`: Starts the development server with hot module replacement.
* `npm run build` or `yarn build` or `pnpm build`: Builds the production-ready application. The output will be in the `dist` directory.
* `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` or `pnpm lint`: Runs the ESLint linter to check for code style issues.
* `npm run preview` or `yarn preview` or `pnpm preview`: Starts a local server to preview the production build.
